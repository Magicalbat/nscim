# Neoscim

## A vim-like spreadsheet calculator.

This project takes inspiration from [sc-im](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im), hence the nscim name, but unlike nvim, this is not a fork of sc-im.

This is really just the spreadsheet software I want to make with keybindings that favor my preferences while being inspired by vim and sc-im.
